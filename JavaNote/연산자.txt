## 연산자

    수치연산, 상관연산자, 논리연산자

    수치연산: Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
	     +, -, *, /, %...

    상관연산자: Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.The return value of a comparison is either true or false. These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.
	       ==, !=, >, <, >= , <= 

    논리연산자: You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.
	        &&(AND), ||(OR), !(NOT)
